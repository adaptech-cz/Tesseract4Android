/*
 * textorient.c
 *
 *   This attempts to identify the orientation of text in the image.
 *   If text is found, it is rotated by a multiple of 90 degrees
 *   to make it right-side up.  It is not further deskewed.
 *   This works for roman mixed-case text.  It will not work if the
 *   image has all caps or all numbers.  It has not been tested on
 *   other scripts.

 *   Usage:
 *     textorient filein minupconf minratio fileout
 *
 *   You can use minupconf = 0.0, minratio = 0.0 for default values,
 *   which are:
 *       minupconf = 8.0, minratio = 2.5
 *   fileout is the output file name, without the extension, which is
 *   added here depending on the encoding chosen for the output pix.
 *
 *   Example on 1 bpp image:
 *     textorient feyn.tif 0.0 0.0 feyn.oriented
 *   which generates the file
 *     feyn.oriented.tif
 *
