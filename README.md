# Tesseract4Android

Fork of tess-two rewritten from scratch to build with CMake and support latest Android Studio and Tesseract OCR.

The Java/JNI wrapper files and tests for Leptonica / Tesseract are based on the [tess-two project][tess-two], which is based on [Tesseract Tools for Android][tesseract-android-tools].

## Dependencies

This project uses additional libraries (with their own specific licenses):

 - [Tesseract][tesseract-ocr] 4.1.1
 - [Leptonica][leptonica] 1.80.0
 - [libjpeg][jpeg] v9d
 - [libpng][png] 1.6.37

## Prerequisites

 - Android 4.1 (API 16) or higher
 - A v4.0.0 [trained data file(s)][tessdata] for language(s) you want to use. Data files must be
copied to the Android device to a directory named `tessdata`.
 - If you want to use PdfRenderer, copy also [pdf.ttf][pdffile] file to the `tessdata` directory.
 - Application must hold permission `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` to access `tessdata` directory.

## Usage

To use Tesseract4Android in your project add dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

    dependencies {
        implementation 'cz.adaptech.android:tesseract4android:2.1.1'
    }

## Building

You can use Android Studio (tested on version 4.1.2) to open the project and build the AAR. Or you can use `gradlew` from command line.

To build the release version of the library, use task `tesseract4android:assembleRelease`. After successful build, you will have resulting `AAR` file in the `<project dir>/tesseract4Android/build/outputs/aar/` directory.

### Android Studio

 - Open this project in Android Studio.
 - Open Gradle panel, expand `Tesseract4Android / :tesseract4Android / Tasks / other` and run `assembleRelease`.

### GradleW

 - In project directory create `local.properties` file containing:

       sdk.dir=c\:\\your\\path\\to\\android\\sdk
       ndk.dir=c\:\\your\\path\\to\\android\\ndk

   Note for paths on Windows you must use `\` to escape some special characters, as in example above.

 - Call `gradlew tesseract4android:assembleRelease` from command line.
